<h3>Althing<h3>




<p>
The Althing is an annual event hosted by NZV. Be you Norse, Viking, SCA, Roman or other, come step back in time with us. Set up mini villages or come on your own. Join the battles, archery or other skills. Dance, sing and partake of the merriment. Competitions, feasts, shared or within your 'village'. Win prizes, make friends. NZV Althing will endeavor to keep costs as low as possible working towards it being a 'must do' event on you or your clubs calendar.
