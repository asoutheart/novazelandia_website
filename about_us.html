<h3>About us</h3>



<p>
NZV & Medieval Reenactment Group are people who love history. 
It's a way of life, and a place to learn arts and skills from bygone eras. 
Join to learn combat skills as part of our fighting/display team known as Wolves of Odin(TM). 
Some join due to genetic connections with ancestors to seek further knowledge. 
Some enjoy the battle, while others the dance, music, crafting of old. 
Some are actors and entertainers. Some like practicing authentic true skills, using old tools and craftsmanship. 
Whatever the drive, be you from 700-900 CE Norse/Viking, or further forward to Renaissance, French, even Roman etc, we are a place where you can bring living history to life and share with others. 
We host displays, encampments and community events you may attend. Teacher or student, learn and share the many skills in our growing club. 
There is something for everyone and for most levels of physical abilities. The club runs on donations, such as canvas tents, tools, armor etc, sporting goods, crafting supplies, costumes. 
Currently there are no club fees (Note: encampments at public facilities, campsites etc, may incur a site fee). Engaged trainers or skilled instructors in crafts, other types of fighting skills etc may include a fee. See you in the past.

<h3>The history of Nova Zeelandia Vikings</h3>

<p>
Many years ago a fine man, Paul Kirk, had a dream to build a club, a viking group and community. With a few others he brought his dream to life but sadly died suddenly, shaking its foundation. While a few tried to keep the club alive over many years, by 2023 there were only a small number left. The founders dream fading into distant memories. In early 2023 a new family joined. Having met the wonderful founder of the club before he died, the new Nova Zeelandia Vikings family invested in everything, from their own pockets, along with huge amounts of time, to build and bring back to life that dream. They gave credit to others, often stepping back so others could shine. Others sometimes taking that credit in Hollywood viking style. 

Honoring the past and what once was held strong is maintained by these new, energetic people. Breathing life back into what was almost gone. Putting into place guidelines and some structure which had not been there before, but were needed to fall in line with what other groups accept as good organizational policy. Strong well established groups who had paved the way for many others. By this time the club membership was rising significantly and as such, aligning with the practices of other clubs was and still is, our way to honor Paul Kirk the founder, and early foundation members. As true vikings have done through history with honor. While Hollywood, stories and others portrayed the viking as a bunch of attacking beasts, the culture, its people, were rich in traditions, respect and beliefs. We work to reflect a beautiful, rich culture and bring it to life.
