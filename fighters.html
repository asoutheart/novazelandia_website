<h3>Fighters<h3>

<p>
Wolves of Odin(TM) from our display team, to Shield Maidens to our youngest, our members are trained in a number of different fighting styles and weaponry. 
While following many battle and training engagement skills set out by more established clubs, preserving the skills of old and bringing them to life is what we love to share. 
Our display team follows policies to keep themselves, other team members and the public safe by following a drug and alcohol free commitment before and during events. 
They understand termination of membership may be swift for breaching of rules and for behaviors that place safety and welfare of others at risk. 
This expectation is not just verbal or written to 'tick the boxes' but a serious commitment and loyalty to the world of reenactment displays. 
Thus we ensure our future growth for many years to come.
